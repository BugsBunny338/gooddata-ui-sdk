This project contains tooling related to handling mock data / test data. This is developer tooling.

The tooling is of assorted quality - the standards are pretty low :) Not all tools in here necessarily provide
a fancy command line interface (with options, colors and with emojis). Often times they are merely programs
to launch directly from IDE.
