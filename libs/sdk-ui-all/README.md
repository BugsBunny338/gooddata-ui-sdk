# GoodData.UI SDK - All-in-one

This is all-in-one package which has all SDK packages as dependencies and re-exports their public API.

The primary purpose of this package is to simplify migration from previous versions of the GoodData.UI SDK - which were
all delivered in a single @gooddata/react-components package.

We recommend that you only use this package temporarily and refactor your application so that it only depends on the
exact SDK.UI packages.
