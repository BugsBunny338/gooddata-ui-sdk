 *
 * The result instance receives also receives the normalizing execution which triggered creation of
 * the result -> this is so that when client calls transform(), they can get back to further customizing the
 * execution.
 *
 * The result instance receives also the original, non-normalizing prepared execution -> this is needed
 * because of export(). Exports are a server side thing that must be done for the original execution - because
 * the normalization process normally takes away the essential detail that is importat in the exports - such as
 * titles, formats and so on. See the export() implementation - this actually performs the original execution
 * and exports result from it.
