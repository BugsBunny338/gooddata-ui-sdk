# Release process

DISCLAIMER: the process described below is run manually now, but we want to automate all of this on build servers. So if all this seems scary, don't worry :)

## Bumping the version

First, you might need to specify which version you want to create (in case the version you are trying to release is not the same type as the current one, e.g. minor after an alpha release). To do that, edit the `"nextBump"` property in `common/config/rush/version-policies.json`.
Then bump the version â€“ this will update all the package.json files and if the new version is not a prerelease, it will update CHANGELOGS as well:

```bash
rush version --bump --override-prerelease-id alpha
```

## Publishing the new version

First, to check everything is working, run the publish in dry-run mode:

```bash
rush publish --include-all
```

Then, if the that command ran successfully and you are completely sure what you are doing, run

```bash
rush publish --include-all -p
```

That will publish the packages to NPM and will create a git tag. Commit and push these changes.
